Covering rspec-given, minitest-given, and given-core, version 3.8.1.

rspec-given and minitest-given are extensions to your favorite testing
framework to allow Given/When/Then notation when writing specs.

# Why Given/When/Then

RSpec has done a great job of making specifications more readable for
humans. However, I really like the given/when/then nature of Cucumber
stories and would like to follow the same structure in my unit tests.
rspec-given (and now minitest-given) allows a simple given/when/then
structure RSpec specifications.

## Status

* rspec-given and minitest-given are ready for production use.

### RSpec/Given

The rspec-given gem is the original given/when/then extension for
RSpec. It now depends on a given_core gem for the basic functionality
and then adds the RSpec specific code.

* rspec-given now requires RSpec version 2.14.0 or better.

### Minitest/Given

A new minitest-given gem allows Given/When/Then notation directly in
Minitest::Spec specifications.

To use minitest-given, just place the following require at the top of
the file (or in a convenient spec_helper).

```ruby
require 'minitest/given'
```

All the features of rspec-given are available in minitest-given.

When switching from RSpec/Given to Minitest/Given, here are some
things to watch out for:

* You need to use Minitest version 4.3 or better (yes, Minitest 5.x
  should work as well).

* Minitest/Given adds the missing "context" block to Minitest::Spec.

* Only one before block is allowed in any given Minitest::Spec
  describe block. This doesn't effect the number of Givens you are
  allowed to use, but it may surprise you if you are used to RSpec.

### Auto Selecting

If you use natural assertions exclusively in your specs, it's quite
possible to write specs that run under both RSpec and Minitest::Spec.

Use this at the start of your spec file:

```ruby
if defined?(RSpec)
  require 'rspec/given'
else
  require 'minitest/autorun'
  require 'minitest/given'
end
```

See
[stack_spec.rb](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/blob/minispec/examples/stack/stack_spec.rb)
and
[example_helper.rb](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/blob/minispec/examples/example_helper.rb)

## Installation

### If you are using bundler

Add `rspec-given` (or `minitest-given`) to the `:test` group in the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-given'
end
```

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'minitest-given'
end
```

Download and install:

`$ bundle`

Then just require `rspec/given` (or `minitest/given`) in the
`spec_helper` of your project and it is ready to go.

### If you are not using bundler

Install the gem:

`$ gem install rspec-given`

or

`$ gem install minitest-given`

Then just require `rspec/given` (or `minitest/given`) in the
`spec_helper` of your project and it is ready to go.

## Example

Here is a specification written in the rspec-given framework:

```ruby
require 'rspec/given'
require 'spec_helper'
require 'stack'

describe Stack do
  def stack_with(initial_contents)
    stack = Stack.new
    initial_contents.each do |item| stack.push(item) end
    stack
  end

  Given(:stack) { stack_with(initial_contents) }
  Invariant { stack.empty? == (stack.depth == 0) }

  context "with no items" do
    Given(:initial_contents) { [] }
    Then { stack.depth == 0 }

    context "when pushing" do
      When { stack.push(:an_item) }

      Then { stack.depth == 1 }
      Then { stack.top == :an_item }
    end

    context "when popping" do
      When(:result) { stack.pop }
      Then { result == Failure(Stack::UnderflowError, /empty/) }
    end
  end

  context "with one item" do
    Given(:initial_contents) { [:an_item] }

    context "when popping" do
      When(:pop_result) { stack.pop }

      Then { pop_result == :an_item }
      Then { stack.depth == 0 }
    end
  end

  context "with several items" do
    Given(:initial_contents) { [:second_item, :top_item] }
    Given!(:original_depth) { stack.depth }

    context "when pushing" do
      When { stack.push(:new_item) }

      Then { stack.top == :new_item }
      Then { stack.depth == original_depth + 1 }
    end

    context "when popping" do
      When(:pop_result) { stack.pop }

      Then { pop_result == :top_item }
      Then { stack.top == :second_item }
      Then { stack.depth == original_depth - 1 }
    end
  end
end
```

Let's talk about the individual statements used in the Given
framework.

### Given

The _Given_ section specifies a starting point, a set of preconditions
that must be true before the code under test is allowed to be run.  In
standard test frameworks the preconditions are established with a
combination of setup methods (or :before actions in RSpec) and code in
the test.

In the example code above the preconditions are started with _Given_
statements.  A top level _Given_ (that applies to the entire describe
block) says that one of the preconditions is that there is a stack
with some initial contents.

Note that initial contents are not specified in the top level describe
block, but are given in each of the nested contexts.  By pushing the
definition of "initial_contents" into the nested contexts, we can vary
them as needed for that particular context.

A precondition in the form "Given(:var) {...}" creates an accessor
method named "var".  The accessor is lazily initialized by the code
block.  If you want a non-lazy given, use "Given!(:var) {...}".

A precondition in the form "Given {...}" just executes the code block
for side effects.  Since there is no accessor, the code block is
executed immediately (i.e. no lazy evaluation).

The preconditions are run in order of definition.  Nested contexts
will inherit the preconditions from the enclosing context, with outer
preconditions running before inner preconditions.

#### Given examples:

```ruby
    Given(:stack) { Stack.new }
```

The block for the given clause is lazily run and its value bound to
'stack' if 'stack' is ever referenced in the test.
The first reference to 'stack' in the specification will cause the
code block to execute. Futher references to 'stack' will reuse the
previously generated value.

```ruby
    Given!(:original_size) { stack.size }
```

The code block is run unconditionally once before each test and the
value of the block is bound to 'original_size'.  This form is useful
when you want to record the value of something that might be affected
by the When code.

```ruby
    Given { stack.clear }
```

The block for the given clause is run unconditionally once before each
test. This form of given is used for code that is executed for side
effects.

### When

The _When_ clause specifies the code to be tested ... oops, excuse me
... specified.  After the preconditions in the given section are met,
the when code block is run.

In general there should not be more than one _When_ clause for a given
direct context. However, a _When_ in an outer context will be run
after all the _Givens_ but before the inner _When_. You can think of
an outer _When_ as setting up additional given state for the inner
_When_.

E.g.

```ruby
    context "outer context" do
      When { code specified in the outer context }
      Then { assert something about the outer context }

      context "inner context" do

        # At this point, the _When_ of the outer context will be run
        # before the _When_ of then inner context (but after all the
        # _Givens_ of all the contexts).  You can think of the outer
        # _When_ as a special given for the inner scope.

        When { code specified in the inner context }
        Then { assert something about the inner context }
      end
    end
```

#### When examples:

```ruby
    When { stack.push(:item) }
```

The code block is executed once per test.  The effect of the _When{}_
block is very similar to _Given{}_.  However, When is used to identify
the particular code that is being specified in the current context or
describe block.

```ruby
    When(:result) { stack.pop }
```

The code block is executed once per test and the value of the code
block is bound to 'result'.  Use this form when the code under test
returns a value that you wish to interrogate in the _Then_ code.

If an exception occurs during the execution of the block for the When
clause, the exception is caught and a failure object is bound to
'result'. The failure can be checked in a then block with the
'have_failed' matcher.

The failure object will rethrow the captured exception if anything
other than have_failed matcher is used on the failure object.

For example, if the stack is empty when it is popped, then it is
reasonable for pop to raise an UnderflowError. This is how you might
specify that behavior:

```ruby
    When(:result) { stack.pop }
    Then { expect(result).to have_failed(UnderflowError, /empty/) }
```

The arguments to the 'have_failed' matcher are the same as
those given to the standard RSpec matcher 'raise_error'.

*NOTE:* Prior to RSpec 3, the .should method worked with the failed
result. In RSpec 3 the <code>.should</code> method is deprecated and
should not be used with the failed result.

### Then

The _Then_ clauses are the postconditions of the specification. These
then conditions must be true after the code under test (the _When_
clause) is run.

The code in the block of a _Then_ clause should be a single _should_
assertion. Code in _Then_ clauses should not have any side effects.

Let me repeat that: <b>_Then_ clauses should not have any side
effects!</b> _Then_ clauses with side effects are erroneous. _Then_
clauses need to be idempotent, so that running them once, twice, a
hundred times, or never does not change the state of the program. (The
same is true of _And_ and _Invariant_ clauses).

In RSpec terms, a _Then_ clause forms a RSpec Example that runs in the
context of an Example Group (defined by a describe or context clause).

Each Example Group must have at least one _Then_ clause, otherwise
there will be no examples to be run for that group. If all the
assertions in an example group are done via Invariants, then the group
should use an empty _Then_ clause, like this:

```ruby
    Then { }
```

A _Then_ clause accepts arguments for user-defined RSpec metadata:

```ruby
    Then(:zippy, :foo => 17) { ... }
```

Metadata on _Then_ clauses is an RSpec-only feature. You can read more about
metadata [in RSpec's
documentation](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/metadata/user-defined-metadata).


#### Then examples:

```ruby
    Then { stack.empty? }
```

After the related block for the _When_ clause is run, the stack should
be empty. If it is not empty, the test will fail.

### And

The _And_ clause is similar to _Then_, but does not form its own RSpec
example. This means that _And_ clauses reuse the setup from a sibling
_Then_ clause. Using a single _Then_ and multiple _And_ clauses in an
example group means the setup for that group is run only once (for the
_Then_ clause) and reused for all the _And_ clauses. This can be a
significant speed savings where the setup for an example group is
expensive.

Some things to keep in mind about _And_ clauses:

* There must be at least one _Then_ in the example group and it must
  be declared before the _And_ clauses. Forgetting the _Then_ clause
  is an error.

* The code in the _And_ clause is run immediately after the first
  (executed) _Then_ of an example group.

* An assertion failure in a _Then_ clause or an _And_ clause will
  cause all the subsequent _And_ clauses to be skipped.

* Since _And_ clauses do not form their own RSpec examples, they are
  not represented in the formatted output of RSpec. That means _And_
  clauses do not produce dots in the Progress format, nor do they
  appear in the documentation, html or textmate formats (options
  -fhtml, -fdoc, or -ftextmate).

* Like _Then_ clauses, _And_ clauses must be idempotent. That means
  they should not execute any code that changes global program state.
  (See the section on the _Then_ clause).

The choice to use an _And_ clause is primarily a speed consideration.
If an example group has expensive setup and there are a lot of _Then_
clauses, then choosing to make some of the _Then_ clauses into _And_
clauses will speed up the spec. Otherwise it is probably better to
stick with _Then_ clauses.

#### Then/And examples:

```ruby
  Then { pop_result == :top_item }           # Required
  And  { stack.top == :second_item }         # No Setup rerun
  And  { stack.depth == original_depth - 1 } # ... for these
```

### Invariant

The _Invariant_ clause is a new idea that doesn't have an analog in
RSpec or Test::Unit. The invariant allows you specify things that must
always be true in the scope of the invariant. In the stack example, the method
<tt>empty?</tt> is defined in term of <tt>size</tt>.

```ruby
  Invariant { stack.empty? == (stack.depth == 0) }
```

This invariant states that <code>empty?</code> is true if and only if
the stack depth is zero, and that assertion is checked at every _Then_
clause that is in the same scope.

You can conceptually think of an _Invariant_ clause as a _Then_ block
that automatically gets added to every _Then_ within its scope.
Invariants nested within a context only apply to the _Then_ clauses
that are in the scope of that context.

Invariants that reference a _Given_ precondition accessor must only be
used in contexts that define that accessor.

Notes:

* Since Invariants do not form their own RSpec example, they are not
  represented in the RSpec formatted output (e.g. the '--format html'
  option).

## Execution Ordering

When running the test for a specific _Then_ clause, the following will
be true:

* The non-lazy _Given_ clauses will be run in the order that they are
  specified, from the outermost scope to the innermost scope
  containing the _Then_. (The lazy _Given_ clauses will be run upon
  demand).

* All of the _Given_ clauses in all of the relevant scopes will run
  before the first (outermost) _When_ clause in those same scopes.
  That means that the _When_ code can assume that the givens have been
  established, even if the givens are in a more nested scope than the
  When.

* _When_ clauses and RSpec _before_ blocks will be executed in the
  order that they are specified, from the outermost block to the
  innermost block. This makes _before_ blocks an excellent choice when
  writing narrative tests to specify actions that happen between the
  "whens" of a narrative-style test.

Note that the ordering between _Given_ clauses and _before_ blocks are
not strongly specified. Hoisting a _When_ clause out of an inner scope
to an outer scope may change the order of execution between related
_Given_ clauses and any _before_ blocks (hoisting the _When_ clause
might cause the related _Given_ clauses to possibly run earlier).
Because of this, do not split order dependent code between _Given_
clauses and _before_ blocks.

## Natural Assertions

RSpec/Given now supports the use of "natural assertions" in _Then_,
_And_, and _Invariant_ blocks. Natural assertions are just Ruby
conditionals, without the _should_ or _expect_ methods that RSpec
provides.

When using natural assertions, the value of the _Then_ expression
determines the pass/fail state of the test.  If the expression is
true, the test passes.  If the test is false, the test fails.

If the _Then_ expression executes an RSpec (or MiniTest) assertion
(e.g. uses <code>should</code>, <code>expect</code> or
<code>assert_xxx</code>), then the true/false value will be ignored.
This allows natural assertions and regular assertions clauses to be
intermixed at will.

In addition, if the value of a _Then_ class returns an object that
responds to <code>to_bool</code>, then <code>to_bool</code> will be
called and the return value of that will be used to determine if the
test passed or failed.

Here are the Then/And examples showing natural assertions:

### Using Natural Assertions

```ruby
  Then { stack.top == :second_item }
  Then { stack.depth == original_depth - 1 }
  Then { result == Failure(Stack::UnderflowError, /empty/) }
```

### Using RSpec expect().to

```ruby
  Then { expect(stack.top).to eq(:second_item) }
  Then { expect(stack.depth).to eq(original_depth - 1) }
  Then { expect(result).to have_failed(Stack::UnderflowError, /empty/) }
```

### Using Minitest asserts

```ruby
  Then { assert_equal :second_item, stack.top }
  Then { assert_equal original_depth - 1, stack.depth }
  Then {
    assert_raises(Stack::UnderflowError, /empty/) do
      result.call()
    end
  }
```

### Using Minitest expectations

```ruby
  Then { stack.top.must_equal :second_item }
  Then { stack.depth.must_equal original_depth - 1}
  Then { result.must_raise(Stack::UnderflowError, /empty/) }
```

### Disabling Natural Assertions

Natural assertions may be disabled, either globally or on a per
context basis. See the **configuration** section below to see how to
disable natural assertions project wide.

Here's a heads up: If you use natural assertions, but configure Given
to disable them, then all your specs will mysteriously pass. This is
why the **red** part of _Red/Green/Refactor_ is so important.

### Failure Messages with Natural Assertions

Since natural assertions do not depend upon matchers, you don't get
customized error messages from them. What you _do_ get is a complete
analsysis of the expression that failed.

For example, given the following failing specification:

```ruby
  Given.use_natural_assertions

  describe "Natural Assertions" do
    Given(:foo) { 1 }
    Given(:bar) { 2 }
    Then { foo + bar == 2 }
  end
```

You would get:

```
  1) Natural Assertions
     Failure/Error: Then { foo + bar == 2 }
       Then expression failed at /Users/jim/working/git/rspec-given/examples/failing/sample_spec.rb:6
       expected: 3
       to equal: 2
         false   <- foo + bar == 2
         3       <- foo + bar
         1       <- foo
         2       <- bar
     # ./examples/failing/sample_spec.rb:6:in `block in Then'
```

Notice how the failing expression "<code>foo+bar == 2</code>" was
broken down into subexpressions and values for each subexpression.
This gives you all the information you need to figure out exactly what
part of the expression is causing the failure.

Natural assertions will give additional information (e.g. "expected:
3 to equal: 2") for top level expressions involving any of the
comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) or matching operators (=~,
!~).

### Checking for exceptions with Natural Assertions

If you wish to see if the result of a _When_ clause is an exception,
you can use the following:

```ruby
    When(:result) { stack.pop }
    Then { result == Failure(UnderflowError, /empty/) }
```

The <code>Failure()</code> method accepts the same arguments as
<code>have_failed</code> and <code>raise_error</code>.

### Caveats on Natural Assertions

Keep the following in mind when using natural assertions.

* Only a single expression/assertion per _Then_. The single expression
  of the _Then_ block will be considered when determining pass/fail
  for the assertion. If you _want_ to express a complex condition for
  the _Then_, you need to use ||, && or some other logical operation
  to join the conditions into a single expression (and the failure
  message will break down the values for each part).

* Then clauses need be **idempotent**. This is true in general, but it
  is particularly important for natural assertions to obey this
  restriction. This means that assertions in a Then clause should not
  change anything. Since the Natural Assertion error message contains
  the values of all the subexpressions, the expression and its
  subexpressions will be evaluated multiple times. If the Then clause
  is not idempotent, you will get changing answers as the
  subexpressions are evaluated.

That last point is important. If you write code like this:

```ruby
  # DO NOT WRITE CODE LIKE THIS
  context "Incorrect non-idempotent conditions" do
    Given(:ary) { [1, 2, 3] }
    Then { ary.delete(1) == nil }
  end
```

Then the assertion will fail (because <code>ary.delete(1)</code> will
initially return 1). But when the error message is formated, the
system reports that <code>ary.delete(1)</code> returns nil. You will
scratch your head over that for a good while.

Instead, move the state changing code into a _When(:result)_ block, then
assert what you need to about :result. Something
like this is good:

```ruby
  context "Correct idempotent conditions" do
    Given(:ary) { [1, 2, 3] }
    When(:result) { ary.delete(1) }
    Then { result == nil }
  end
```

It is good to note that non-idempotent assertions will also cause
problems with And and Invariant clauses.

### Mixing Natural Assertions and RSpec Assertions

Natural assertions, RSpec should assertions and Minitest assertions
can be intermixed in a single test suite, even within a single
context.

```ruby
  context "Outer" do
    context "Inner" do
      Then { a == b }               # Natural Assertions
      Then { a.should == b }        # Deprecated RSpec style
      Then { expect(a).to eq(b) }   # RSpec style
      Then { assert_equal b, a }    # Minitest style
      Then { a.must_equal b }       # Minitest style
    end

    context "Disabled" do
      use_natural_assertions false
    end
  end
```

Both the _Outer_ and _Inner_ contexts will use natural assertions. The
_Disabled_ context overrides the setting inherited from _Outer_ and
will not process natural assertions.

See the **configuration** section below to see how to disable natural
assertions project wide.

### Matchers and Natural Assertions

In RSpec, matchers are used to provide nice, readable error messages
when an assertion is not met. Natural assertions provide
self-explanatory failure messages for most things without requiring
any special matchers from the programmer.

In the rare case that some extra information would be helpful, it is
useful to create special objects that respond to the == operator.

#### Asserting Nearly Equal with Fuzzy Numbers

Operations on floating point numbers rarely create numbers that are
exactly equal, therefore it is useful to assert that two floating
point numbers are nearly equal. We do that by creating a fuzzy number
that has a looser interpretation of what it means to be equal.

For example, the following asserts that the square root of 10 is about
3.1523 with an accuracy of 1 percent.

```ruby
    Then { Math.sqrt(10) == about(3.1623).percent(1) }
```

As long as the real value of <code>Math.sqrt(10)</code> is within plus
or minus 1% of 3.1623 (i.e. 3.1623 +/- 0.031623), then the assertion
will pass.

There are several ways of creating fuzzy numbers:

* <code>about(n).delta(d)</code> -- A fuzzy number matching the range
  (n-d)..(n+d)

* <code>about(n).percent(p)</code> -- A fuzzy number matching the
  range (n-(n*p/100)) .. (n+(n*p/100))

* <code>about(n).epsilon(neps)</code> -- A fuzzy number matching the
  range (n-(neps*e)) .. (n+(neps*e)), where e is the difference
  between 1.0 and the next smallest floating point number.

* <code>about(n)</code> -- Same as <code>about(n).epsilon(10)</code>.

When the file <code>given/fuzzy_shortcuts</code> is required,
the following unicode shortcut methods are added to Numeric to create
fuzzy numbers.

* <code>n.±(del)</code> is the same as <code>about(n).delta(del)</code>

* <code>n.‰(percentage)</code> is the same as <code>about(n).percent(percentage)</code>

* <code>n.€(neps)</code> is the same as <code>about(n).epsilon(neps)</code>

* <code>n.±</code>, <code>n.‰</code>, and <code>n.€</code> are all
  the same as <code>about(n)</code>

#### Detecting Exceptions

The RSpec matcher used for detecting exceptions will work with natural
assertions out of the box. Just check for equality against the
<code>Failure()</code> method return value.

For example, the following two Then clauses are equivalent:

```ruby
    # Using an RSpec matcher
    Then { expect(result).to have_failed(StandardError, /message/) }

    # Using natural assertions
    Then { result == Failure(StandardError, /message/) }
```

### Processing Natural Assertions

When natural assertions are enabled, they are only used if all of the
following are true:

1. The block does not throw an RSpec assertion failure (or any other
   exception for that matter).

1. The block returns false (blocks that return true pass the
   assertion and don't need a failure message).

1. The block does not use the native frameworks assertions or
   expectations (e.g. RSpec's _should_ or _expect_ methods, or
   Minitest's _assert\_xxx_ or _must\_xxx_ methods).

Detecting that last point (the use of _should_ and _expect_) is done
by modifying the RSpec runtime to report uses of _should_ and
_expect_.

### Platform Support

Given uses the Ripper library to parse the source lines and failing
conditions to find all the sub-expression values upon a failure.

If Ripper is not available, like on Rubinius and versions of JRuby prior to
JRuby-1.7.5, detailed explanations of failures for natural assertions won't be
available.  Natural assertions will still work, though.

If you want to use a version of Ruby that does not support Ripper, then you
should disable source caching in the configuration (see the configuration
section below).

### Non-Spec Assertions

Given also provides three assertions meant to be used in
non-test/non-spec code. For example, here is a square root function
decked out with pre and post-condition assertions.

```ruby
require 'given/assertions'
require 'given/fuzzy_number'

include Given::Assertions
include Given::Fuzzy

def sqrt(n)
  Precondition { n >= 0 }
  result = Math.sqrt(n)
  Postcondition { result ** 2 == about(n) }
  result
end
```

To use the non-testing assertions, you need to require the
'given/assertions' file and then include the
<code>Given::Assertions</code> module into what ever class is using
the
<code>Precondition</code>/<code>Postcondition</code>/<code>Assert</code>
methods. The code block for these assertions should always be a
regular Ruby true/false value (the <code>should</code> and
<code>expect</code> methods from RSpec are not available).

Note that this example also uses the fuzzy number matching, but that
is not required for the assertions themselves.

The assertion methods are:

* <code>Precondition { bool }</code> -- If the block evaluates to
  false (or nil), throw a Given::Assertions::PreconditionError.

* <code>Postcondition { bool }</code> -- If the block evaluates to
  false (or nil), throw a Given::Assertions::PostconditionError.

* <code>Assert { bool }</code> -- If the block evaluates to
  false (or nil), throw a Given::Assertions::AssertError.

Both PreconditionError and PostconditionError are subclasses of
AssertError.

You can disable assertion checking with one of the following commands:

* <code>Given::Assertions.enable_preconditions bool</code> --
  Enable/Disable precondition assertions.
  (default to enable)

* <code>Given::Assertions.enable_postconditions bool</code> --
  Enable/Disable postcondition assertions.
  (default to enable)

* <code>Given::Assertions.enable_asserts bool</code> --

### Further Reading

Natural assertions were inspired by the [wrong assertion
library](http://rubygems.org/gems/wrong) by [Alex
Chaffee](http://rubygems.org/profiles/alexch) and [Steve
Conover](http://rubygems.org/profiles/sconoversf).

## Configuration

If the RSpec format option document, html or textmate is chosen,
RSpec/Given will automatically add additional source code information to
the examples to produce better looking output. If you don't care about
the pretty output and wish to disable source code caching
unconditionally, then add the following line to your spec helper file:

```ruby
    Given.source_caching_disabled = true
```

Natural assertions are enabled by default. To globally configure
natural assertions, add one of the following lines to your spec_helper
file:

```ruby
    Given.use_natural_assertions         # Enable natural assertions
    Given.use_natural_assertions true    # Same as above
    Given.use_natural_assertions false   # Disable natural assertions
    Given.use_natural_assertions :always # Always process natural assertions
                                         # ... even when should/expect are detected
```

# History

* Version 3.8.1

  * Fix deprecation warnings fro Ruby 2.6 & up

* Version 3.8.0

  * RSpec metadata can now be added to _Then_ clauses (see [#11](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/pull/11))
  * Natural assertions now run on Rubinius and older versions of JRuby (see [#15](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/issues/15))
    * WARNING: On these platforms, detailed failure explanations aren't available and source code snippets of Then clauses will only show the first line.
    * WARNING: Assertions of void statements (e.g. `Then { }`) will fail only under runtimes lacking Ripper support
  * `Given.ok_to_use_natural_assertions` was removed; the method was never properly supported as public, but it was publicly reachable

* Version 3.7.1

  * Mixin Minitest extensions for both ActiveSupport::TestCase (when present) as well as for MiniTest::Spec (see [#8](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/pulls/8))

* Version 3.7.0

  * Add support for Rails tests when using minitest-given (See [#6](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/pull/6))

* Version 3.6.0

  * Various fixes for RSpec 3.0 (See [#1](https://github.com/rspec-given/rspec-given/pull/1))

* Version 3.5.4

  * Accommodate the name change on RSpec's Pending exception.

* Version 3.5.3

  * source_caching_disabled now hard defaults to false, rather than
    attempting to guess the default from the formatters.

* Version 3.5.0

  * Use Ripper to determine complete subexpressions (rather than
    relying on finicky indentation rules.

* Version 3.4.0

  * Bare failure objects in Then clauses will now propagate their
    captured failure (added <code>to_bool</code> to failure object).

* Version 3.3.0

  * Add support for <code>to_bool</code>.
  * Restrict length of inspect strings printed to 2000 characters.

* Version 3.2.0

  * Add support for RSpec 3 beta

* Version 3.1.0

  * Add support for Precondition/Postcondition/Assert in non-spec
    code.

* Version 3.0.1

  * Add support for the === operation in natural assertions.

* Version 3.0.0

  * Support for minitest added.

  * Introduced gem given\_core to contain the common logic between the
    RSpec and Minitest versions. Both the rspec-given gem and the
    minitest-given gem have a dependency on given\_core.

  * Natural assertions are now enabled by default.

* Version 2.4.4

  * Support for RSpec 2.13 added.

* Version 2.4.3

  * Better natural assertion messages when dealing with multi-line
    output.

* Version 2.4.2

  * Minor adjustment to natural assertion error messages to better
    handle multi-line values.

  * Remove flog, flay and other development tools from the bundle and
    gemspec. The Rakefile was updated to suggest installing them if
    they are not there.

* Version 2.4.1
